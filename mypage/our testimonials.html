                        degree and into my work once I graduated. Dr. North was always aware of what I needed to improve
                        both my hard and soft skills and always took the time to coach me through those improvements. I
                        view my time and experiences with him as essential to who I am today and to the path which I am
                        following. These experiences have helped me to see that Dr. North has a great way of helping

                        strengths and overcome their weaknesses.”
